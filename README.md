## Overview
A showcase of the `gamepad.js` utility for the Wonderland Engine that lets you easily retrieve controller button state, play a pulse effect, register to controller event and so on.

Left gamepad and right gamepad in game are handled differently to showcase different ways to use `gamepad.js`:
  - Left is managed by polling the status of the gamepad
  - Right is managed by registering to gamepad events

You can find a live version of the `gamepad.js` [here](https://elia-ducceschi.itch.io/gamepad-wonderland-engine).

## How to import and use gamepad.js
To import `gamepad.js` you have to:
- Import `gamepad.js` somewhere inside your `project` folder
- Import the `pp` folder into your `project` folder, this folder contains the `pp.js` file with the `PP` namespace declaration in it
  - This folder should only contain this item
  - You must link this folder in the Java Script Sources list (under Project Settings) before any other folders that contain scripts that use the `PP` namespace
  - This is needed to make sure the `PP` namespace is created before it is used 
  - If you put it as first (after `/js/components/`) you should be safe
  - If you don't want to use the `PP` namespace just remove it from the `gamepad.js` script, in this case you won't need `pp.js`

To use `gamepad.js` you have to:
- Instantiate the Gamepad class for both left and right controller
  - You can instatiate them as global variable, singleton, and so on, as long as you can retrieve them 
- Call start and update on it 
- You could import `gamepads_manager_component.js` component and add it to the Player object to have a simple way to instantiate/start/update the gamepads
  - In this case `PP.LeftGamepad` and `PP.RightGamepad` will be global variables

At this point you can:
- Register/unregister to buttons and axes events
- Poll the buttons or axes state directly
- Add a pulse/vibration/rumble to the gamepad and stop it

## How to import the animated gamepads
If you want to import the gamepad models with the animation of the buttons you have to:
- Import `gamepad.js` as shown above
- Import `gamepad_animator.js`
- Inside `gamepad_animator.js` you can search for `@EDIT` tags where you can/have to make modifications
  - You have to specify how to retrieve the left and right gamepad instances
  - If you are using the `gamepads_manager_component.js` component you just have to specify `PP.LeftGamepad` or `PP.RightGamepad`
  - You can also specify different colors for normal/touched button state, null means the colors will not be changed
- Import the `quest_controllers_credits_Jezza3D.glb` model inside your `project` folder
- Drag and drop the model on the Player object
- On both of them you have to
  - Add input component
  - Specify the handedness
  - Add the gamepad-animator component
  - Specify the handedness
  - Fill the gamepad-animator component with the objects from the imported controller model
